Title:Power BI Dashboard for Coffee Origin & Quality Analysis â€“ Power BI Dashboard

This project aims to visualize and analyze a comprehensive global coffee dataset using Power BI. The primary goal is to uncover insights related to coffee quality, variety, and geographical origin, enabling users to explore patterns and trends through interactive visuals.

This dashboard delivers rich, continent-wise insights into coffee varieties, moisture content, flavor, aroma, and more. It allows users to dynamically filter data by region (Africa, Asia, North America, South America) and visually interpret the results through graphs, maps, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

The dashboard offers detailed breakdowns of:

Coffee varieties (e.g., Bourbon, Catuai, Arusha)

Moisture levels and correlation with flavor scores

Geographical origins with variety-specific mapping

Total aroma and color metrics by variety and continent

ðŸ§© Features & Visuals:
Donut Chart: Count of varieties by moisture level

Bar Chart: Moisture value by continent

Line Graph: Flavor vs. moisture relationship

Cards: Total aroma and color counts per variety

Map: Country of origin based on variety and continent

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Impact:
This project helps stakeholders in the coffee supply chainâ€”like roasters, exporters, analysts, and marketersâ€”understand regional quality trends and make data-driven sourcing decisions based on origin, flavor, and processing attributes.
